# ironFlight

Project developed during the 5th semester of my formation at SUPSI.
The goal of the project was to create a complex user-interface web application.

The project result is a web interface running on a laptop/desktop which is connected via Socket to a mobile device.
The mobile device sends position informations through the socket and the interface simulates an aircraft flight.
Other infos are also displayed on screen, like Temperature, Meteo, Location, User-agent and others.

It all has been developed with 2 other students: Edoardo Terzi and Roberto Trapletti.
